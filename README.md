# React MobX React-Router 4 Beego Boilerplate

## this is a spin off from [mhaagens boilerplate repo](https://github.com/mhaagens/react-mobx-react-router4-boilerplate)

### :tada: React, React-Router@next, MobX, Webpack 2 and Beego.

## [Demo](http://boilerplate.tozzr.com)

Just run `yarn install` and `npm start`, then go to localhost:3000 to start developing.
To build, run `npm run build`, and to preview run `npm run preview`, then go
to localhost:1234 for the minified production bundle.

#### Async component loading
Components are now loaded async with react-router-loader and the store is injected via MobX Provider. 

#### Authenticating against the backend service
The authentication process is using the beego server (backend) to use stateful session data.
